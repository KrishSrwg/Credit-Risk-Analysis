# Credit-Risk-Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting credit risk using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various factors affecting loan approval, and the goal is to build a predictive model to classify loan status.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of the following key variables:

ID: Unique identifier for each loan applicant.

Age: Age of the loan applicant.

Income: Annual income of the applicant.

Home: Home ownership status (Own, Mortgage, Rent).

Emp_Length: Employment length in years.

Intent: Purpose of the loan (e.g., education, home improvement).

Amount: Loan amount applied for.

Rate: Interest rate on the loan.

Status: Loan approval status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current).

Percent_Income: Loan amount as a percentage of income.

Default: Previous loan default history (Yes/No).

Cred_Length: Length of the applicant's credit history.
